## Hello, I'm Tung Quach

Welcome to my digital garden! I'm a Vietnamese software engineer with a passion for elegant code, efficient systems, and continuous learning. By day, I architect and build scalable solutions; by night, I experiment with new technologies and share what I learn through this blog.

## My Journey

My path into software development began with curiosity about how things work. That curiosity evolved into a career building solutions that solve real problems. Over the years, I've worked across the full development stack but have found my sweet spot in backend development and cloud architecture, with a particular fondness for Golang and distributed systems.

I believe in the power of well-crafted code—not just code that works, but code that's readable, maintainable, and efficient. This philosophy guides everything I build, from side projects to production systems.

## Why This Blog Exists

This space serves multiple purposes:

* **Knowledge Sharing** — Software development thrives on community and shared knowledge. I document solutions to problems I've faced, hoping they'll help others on similar paths.
* **Learning in Public** — Explaining concepts reinforces my understanding. By writing about what I learn, I solidify my own knowledge and identify gaps.
* **English Practice** — As a non-native speaker, writing regularly helps me refine my communication skills in English.
* **Digital Legacy** — This blog is my contribution to the collective knowledge of the internet—a place where I can look back on my journey and perhaps inspire others.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not immersed in code, you might find me exploring new coffee shops, or working on one of my many side projects. I believe in balancing technical depth with the breadth of other interests.

## Let's Connect

I value conversations and connections with fellow developers and tech enthusiasts. If you have questions, feedback, or just want to chat about a shared interest, feel free to reach out:
