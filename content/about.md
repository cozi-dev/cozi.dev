Hi there, thank you for visiting my blog! Iâ€™m a Vietnamese dad, husband, and programmer. Definitely not a native English speaker :)

### Why I write this blog?

* I want to improve my English.
* I think maybe my articles can help someone.
* A place to lookback because I can not remember everything.
