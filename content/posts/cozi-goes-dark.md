Today, I decided to change [cozi.dev](https://cozi.dev) to dark mode and I found out a quite awesome CSS property: `color-scheme`.

```css
body {
    color-scheme: dark;
}
```

Boom! All of the scrolls on my website change to dark color.\
I hope you like the new color scheme.

P/s: It's good for eyes at night :)
