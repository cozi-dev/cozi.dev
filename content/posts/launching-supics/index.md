A few days ago, I launched <a href="https://supics.com" target="_blank">supics.com</a> which is my another side project that let people download/upload wallpapers for any devices.

## Why I built this site?

I love to try and build things :) First, I just want to try <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web" target="_blank">gRPC Web</a>, then I found it interesting and quickly to implements. So Supics was born!

## Stack

Below are the main stack used to quickly build Supics:

* Go
* Vue
* Firebase
* gRPC, gRPC Web
* Envoy
* Imageproxy

## Conclusions

Although many features still need to be built, but after launching Supics, I found that I've learned a lot and it could help me with other projects. Finally, if you have any feedback, please let me know. Thank you!
